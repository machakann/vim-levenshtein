INTRODUCTION				*levenshtein-introduction*

This is a library plugin to calculate Levenshtein and its variant,
ristricted Damerau-Levenshtein distance.

Levenshtein distance is a sort of edit distances. It is defind as a minimum
count to equate two strings by three kinds of operations.

 1. character-wise addition		a  -> ab
 2. character-wise deletion		ab -> a
 3. character-wise substitution		a  -> b

For example, the Levenshtein distance between "a" and "ab" is 1, since an
addition of "b" makes the former equal as the latter. Conversely, "ab" can be
equated by a deletion of "b", therefore it is 1 as same. Similarly, the
Levenshtein distance between "ab" and "ac" is 1, because a substitution of "b"
with "c" make them equal.

Damerau-Levenshtein distance is a variant of the Levenshtein distance. It
accepts one additional operation.

 4. character-wise transposition	ab -> ba

The Damerau-Levenshtein distance of "abc" and "acb" is 1 since a transposition
of "b" and "c" make them equal, while the Levenshtein distance is 2 since two
substitution is necessary.

Note that this library cannot follow the above rule of the Damerau-Levenshtein
distance strictly. There is a limitation for the fourth operation; only a
transposition between two successive characters are allowed.

 4'. character-wise transposition between two successive characters

	Allowed				abc -> bac
	Not allowed			abc -> cba

The ristricted Damerau-Levenshtein distance between "abc" and "cba" is 2 since
two substitution, "a" to "c" and "c" to "a", is necessary, while those
(unristricted) Damerau-Levenshtein distance is 1 since a transposition of the
first "a" and the third "c" does the job. That's the reason why the function
is called "ristricted" Damerau-Levenshtein distance. It is also called optimal
string alignment distance.
